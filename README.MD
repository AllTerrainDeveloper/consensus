# Consensus React App

This repository contains a minimal React application bootstrapped with **Vite** and configured with **React Router**. It uses `react-dom` for rendering the application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

To build the application for production, run `npm run build` and preview it with `npm run preview`.
